This pilot experiment extends our paper (2021) by performing the
light / dark conditioning task. The control subjects received water
while the experimental subjects received 10% sucrose.

The behavioural paradigm and preprocessing steps are identical to our 
paper (2021), with the following modifications:


1) The progressive ratio schedule was increased from 5 to 10.
2) Neuropixels 2.0 probe was used.

The following subjects were included in the final analysis:

sub-01 - control
sub-02 - experimental
sub-03 - experimental
sub-04 - control
sub-07 - experimental

Due to a malfunction in the probe, sub-05 and sub-06 were excluded from all analysis.

NOTES:
1) As food restriction took longer for sub-03 was run first (13/11/2023) 
   before sub-01 (16/11/2023). But, we go by order as assigned prior to food restriction.

2) sub-02 ses-02 had a lot of noise in the recording, and the bandpass filter was run 300-6000 Hz rather
   than 150-8000 Hz. This resulted in good sorting, but is different compared to all other runs. This
   should be reviewed before the main experiment - it may be worth using 300-6000 Hz across all 
   datasets. This will have no adverse effect on sorting and will cover more noise cases. Also see
   sub-04 which had some less significant noise issues. We should review noise on rig 5 on which 
   this experimental was run.

3) In many cases the raw data is too large to store locally. We should in future consider splitting the
   the folder structure between raw and preprocesed. This is especially important considering the 
   mistake for sub-03, ses-01 in which the raw data was erroneously overwritten during preprocessing.

4) Due to a scheduling error, mouse-03 test was run in the morning rather than afternoon. 
   Also, this mouse took 1 extra training session to reach criterion.
